This is a simple simulator game where the goal is to pass fuel tanks to a space station before it collapses. You control a space vehicle and must dock with incoming fuel tanks, then transport them to the space station orbiting above.

The game has three difficulty modes - easy, normal and hard. As the difficulty increases, the fuel tanks come faster, and the space station deteriorates more quickly. You'll need quick reflexes and precise control to succeed!

The simple mechanics and straightforward goal make this an accessible game for beginners to enjoy. But completing the higher-difficulty modes takes focus and practice.

Overall, this is a great example of how a basic simulator game can be coded in Java and provide engaging gameplay. Give it a try to see how fun coding your own simple game can be!
